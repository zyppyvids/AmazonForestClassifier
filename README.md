## Abstract
Deforestation in the Amazon Basin has severe consequences on biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. Timely and accurate monitoring of deforestation is crucial for effective response. In this research, we propose a solution to the Planet dataset challenge, which involves classifying satellite images to identify deforestation and land cover/land use classes. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a subset of the dataset, leveraging its ability to learn spatial patterns in images. The model is augmented with data augmentation techniques to enhance its generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate promising performance in identifying deforestation patterns and land cover/land use classes, providing valuable insights for understanding and combating deforestation.

## Introduction
Deforestation in the Amazon Basin accounts for a significant loss of forest cover, contributing to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. Accurate monitoring of deforestation and understanding its causes and patterns is crucial for effective response and conservation efforts. The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, such as the Planet dataset, presents an opportunity to leverage machine learning techniques for automated deforestation detection and land cover/land use classification.
